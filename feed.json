A x86 version is no longer included in the game package since it doubles the file size of the game even though only the x64 package is used on Xbox. I also updated the cover art but to see the change on Xbox you may have to delete and redownload the game.</p>\n<p>That's it for this update, if you come across any issues send them my way and I will look into them.</p>",
